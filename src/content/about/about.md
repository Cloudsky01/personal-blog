# About Me

Hi — I’m **Antoine**, a full-stack developer, mobility nerd, and product builder based in Montréal.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked at companies like **Communauto**, **Explor.ai**, and **Astus**, building real-time systems, infrastructure automation, and user-facing tools that help people move, book, or understand the world around them.

I'm currently a software developer at **O'clock**, where I built reservation platforms like **Golf O’Clock** and **Bowl O’Clock**, serving tens of thousands of users across Québec. I love blending simplicity, code, and a real-world use case — whether that’s scheduling tee times or tracking cars in the city.

## Why I Built This Blog

I started this blog to publish small tools, ideas, and explorations — especially around carsharing, cloud infrastructure, and civic tech. A lot of great thinking never gets shared because it’s “not finished.” This is me choosing to share anyway.

Sometimes I build things no one asked for (like a carsharing cost estimator), and sometimes I write about how tech decisions go sideways. Either way, this site is my sandbox.

## What You’ll Find Here

* Personal dev projects (real-time apps, schedulers, etc.)
* Pricing tools for carsharing and mobility services
* Thoughts on code, cities, and working in tech
