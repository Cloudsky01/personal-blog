At Explor.ai, I worked on internal tools and infrastructure that supported AI-driven insights. My responsibilities ranged from backend API development (FastAPI, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js) to DevOps, and included leading efforts on CI/CD, and observability.

I also contributed to early product prototyping and engaged with the data infra team to ensure pipeline resilience and model deployment compatibility.
