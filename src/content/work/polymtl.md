I supported students in *Méthodes de développement et conception d'applications web (LOG2440)*, a university course focused on full-stack development. My responsibilities included assisting in code reviews, guiding students through best practices in React, Node.js, and testing, and answering technical and architectural questions.

I also helped improve the feedback process and grading consistency through internal tooling.
