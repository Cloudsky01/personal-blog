At O'clock, I helped lead the technical development of two SaaS platforms: **Golf O’Clock** and **Bowl O’Clock**, which together served over **80,000+ users**. I architected the full stack — from reservations to billing — using modern web technologies (SvelteKit, Firebase, GCP).

I focused on delivering a smooth kiosk experience, robust admin tools, and fast iteration cycles, all while scaling a product used by real-world customers in leisure and sports businesses.
