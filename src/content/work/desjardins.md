I worked as a DevOps intern on the **GCP platform team** at Desjardins, helping build tooling and infrastructure to support internal teams deploying to Google Cloud.

My contributions included writing **Terraform modules**, automating **CI/CD pipelines**, and improving the observability of key cloud services. I also participated in security reviews and cost optimization initiatives, gaining experience in managing cloud infrastructure at enterprise scale.
