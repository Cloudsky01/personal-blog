At Astus, I contributed to a fleet management SaaS for **Communauto**, one of North Americaâ€™s largest carsharing platforms. I implemented features using **tRPC, Express, TypeScript, MySQL**, and managed automation with **Semaphore and Ansible**.

I also designed real-time components for monitoring vehicle availability, improving infrastructure with GCP, and built internal tools for operators and support teams.
