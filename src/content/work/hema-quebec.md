At Héma-Québec, I contributed to internal systems that supported blood product traceability and quality assurance. My work included developing .NET desktop tools, automating Excel-heavy workflows, and enhancing data reporting reliability.

This role gave me early exposure to high-stakes environments where precision, traceability, and software correctness directly impact healthcare operations.
