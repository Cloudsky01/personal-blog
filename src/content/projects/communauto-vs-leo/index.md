![Preview of Estimator](/leo-vs-communauto-preview.png)

**Leo vs Communauto Estimator** is a simple, no-BS tool that helps Montréal carshare users figure out which service is actually cheaper — based on real-world usage, not marketing fluff.

I built this after personally using both services across various life scenarios and realizing: no one really knows which one saves them money.

## 🧠 Why I Built It

As a former **Software Engineer at Communauto**, I’ve worked on the backend systems that power real-time carsharing platforms. I love what they’re building.

But I’m also happy Leo showed up. Competition makes things better — for users, for cities, for innovation.

This estimator is **solution-based**, not tribal. It’s for people who just want the best option for their needs — without the bias.
